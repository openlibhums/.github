# We are the Open Library of Humanities Tech Team

We build and maintain the systems that support the Open Library of Humanities and its publishing partners. Most of our work centres on Janeway, our open-source publishing platform for journals.

We work in the open, use open tools, and welcome contributions from others in the publishing and software communities.
